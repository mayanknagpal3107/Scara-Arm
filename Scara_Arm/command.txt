						SCARA ROBOTIC ARM (small)

- All batteries must be full charged.
- The robot will be reset if half or uncomplete command sent.

SERIAL COMMANDS

(NOTE : ALL VALUES ARE IN HEX... )

>>	DATA PACKET Identifiers   =>>  0xFF.....data......0xFF    ( 0xFF - start and stop byte )

>>	Instruction identifier    =>> 2nd byte of data packet



1. To set servo speed (0 to 100) ;   (do not use...)

	255, 100, servo1_speed, servo2_speed, 255  
		
		servo1_speed == 0 to 100
		servo2_speed == 0 to 100
		servo3_speed == 0 to 100


2. To set servo position (0 to 180) ;

	255, 101,servo1_postion, servo2_postion, 255
		
	(all positions are in terms of DEGREES with reference to absolute zero position...)		

		servo1_postion == 0 to 180
		servo2_postion == 0 to 180
		servo3_postion == 0 to 180
		

3. To run dc motor
	
	255, 200, motor_num, direction, 255

		motor_num =  1 to 2
		
		direction=1;//forward
		direction=2;//reverse
		direction=0;//stop

	(NOTE : All directions are relative to DC Motor External Connections...)


4. To set Speed of DC Motor

	255, 201, % Duty_cycle, 255

	(NOTE : to set the speed of perticular DC Motor... firstly run the DC required DC motor in Speed - STOP mode and then enter this command and finally 		run the DCF Motor in required direction.)


5. To read ADC channel

	255, 202, 255

		202 - code for ADC read instruction...
	
	(NOTE : the value of ADC1 channel will be shown on UART...)
